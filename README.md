mxl MicroXML parser
===================

C++ parser for MicroXML &lt;http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/microxml/raw-file/tip/spec/microxml.html> with SAX and expat modes, and numerous options.  Commercial quality, Apache 2.0 license.

For full documentation, download mxlparser_omnihelp.zip, unzip in its own directory, and double-click \_mxlparser.htm.

For those interested in uDoc, a public-domain markup language using MicroXML, download ud_spec_omnihelp.zip, unzip in its own directory, and double-click \_ud_spec.htm.  Or download Word doc in ud_spec_doc.zip.  For the uDoc source, also get ud_spec_src.zip and ud_spec_lib.zip.  The spec src is a good test case for the parser, which is also described in the spec in Appendix D.
